# Configuration
This directory has all the configuration for the project.
The config classes are serialized using GSON for saving configuration to file.
On startup the saved file is deserialized, which loads the saved configuration to classes.
DO NOT RENAME VARIABLES! Otherwise you risk losing configuration.
